# shikari-game

Shikari is a maze escape game, born as a DSA project.

Escape the maze within the time limit.
Don't get stuck on the randomly generated walls, break them or wait until they disappear.

## Roadmap (not in particular order)
- Better gameplay and Player's 'weapon' of choice (to break the walls)
- Multiplayer
- Gameplay improvements & mobile 

Any help or suggestion is widely appreciated!
